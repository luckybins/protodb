The goal of this project is to develop a library/code generation toolkit for reading in protocol buffer definitions (`*`.proto) and generating MySQL table definitions, and data synchronization code.

Using the generated code/library, it should be possible to serialize a protobuf object into a MySQL database, update existing MySQL rows using protobuf objects etc...
